# Marketing Data Analysis Project

## Problem Statement

A restaurant consolidator aims to revamp its B-to-C portal by leveraging intelligent automation technology. The goal is to identify key metrics for recommending restaurants effectively. To achieve this, it's crucial to understand the behavior of the existing data. This project focuses on analyzing the dataset to extract actionable insights that will inform the development of an effective recommendation model.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preliminary Analysis

- **Data Inspection**: Conduct an initial review of the dataset to assess its structure, identify missing values, and detect duplicates.
- **Variable Naming**: Adjust variable names to align with consistent naming conventions.
- **Duplicates Handling**: Identify and remove duplicates based on the findings from the preliminary analysis.

### 2. Data Exploration and Visualization

Prepare a detailed report on the dataset by addressing the following key questions. Visualize the results using appropriate graphs and plots for clarity and impact:

- **Geographical Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities, identifying those with the maximum and minimum number of restaurants.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Explore how restaurant ratings are distributed overall.
- **Franchise Presence**: Identify the restaurant franchise with the most extensive national presence, considering the thriving nature of the franchise business.
- **Table Booking**: Calculate the ratio of restaurants that allow table booking versus those that do not.
- **Online Delivery**: Determine the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery services.
- **Votes Analysis**: Compare the number of votes received by restaurants that offer delivery versus those that do not.
- **Top Cuisines**: Identify the top 10 cuisines served across different cities.
- **Cuisine Variety**: Analyze the maximum and minimum number of cuisines a restaurant serves, and examine the relationship between the number of cuisines offered and the restaurant's ratings.
- **Cost Analysis**: Discuss the relationship between the cost and other variables such as ratings, number of cuisines, and delivery options.
- **Factors Affecting Ratings**: Explain the factors that may influence restaurant ratings, including the number of cuisines, cost, and delivery options.

### 3. Implementation for Model Development

The insights gathered from the data exploration will provide a solid foundation for developing and implementing machine learning models. These models will help in creating a robust recommendation system that can intelligently guide customers to the best restaurants based on various metrics.
